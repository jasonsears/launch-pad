### Database Management

The project uses SQLite with Prisma ORM. Each developer gets their own local `dev.db` file.

**Common commands:**
```bash
# Apply schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data)
npx prisma db push --force-reset

# View database in browser
npx prisma studio
